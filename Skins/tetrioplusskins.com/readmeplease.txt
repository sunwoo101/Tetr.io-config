LOAD EACH SKIN WITH THE TETR.IO+ MODIFICATION CREATED BY UniQMG
Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tetrio-plus/
Desktop prerelease: https://gitlab.com/UniQMG/tetrio-plus/-/releases

Every skin you see right here is in the standardized TETR.IO skin format as of Version 3.2.4, June 19th, 2020. Load them with the "Tetrio-format PNG/JPG" option available in TETR.IO+.

If you got anything to add here, please contact me, ZaptorZap#0405, via discord. The TETR.IO Discord community is an easy spot to find me, links: https://discord.gg/ufDb2XJ 

If you wanna create one, go for it! Feel free to overlay your creation over my format located in ZaptorZap\jstris-tetrio-format.png or create your own! simply make an empty picture with a 12 by 1 canvas, and scale it up to however big you need it. Every block shares the same height and width, and follow the following order:
Z, J, O, S, I, L, T, Ghost or Shadow Piece, "Hold Inactive", Regular Garbage, "Dark Garbage", Topout Warning X

The "Hold Inactive" texture is used on the hold queue piece whenever you hold, signifying the inability to hold.

"Dark Garbage" was showcased during April Fools, 2020 as an unclearable block, leaving that row unclearable. At tetrio's current stage, you cannot see the "Dark Garbage" block anywhere, but it's planned to have that block as an option in the planned map editor.

The Topout Warning X piece will only show if the "Warn Me When I'm In Danger" setting is on.
